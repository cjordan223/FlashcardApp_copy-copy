Wireless networks advertise their presence by regularly broadcasting SSID in a special packet called beacon frame. In wireless networks with disabled security features, knowing the network SSID is enough to get access to the network. SSID also pinpoints the wireless router that acts as a WAP. Wireless routers from the same manufacturer are frequently configured with default (well-known) SSID names.
