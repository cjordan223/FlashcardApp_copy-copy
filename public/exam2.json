      "question": "The term \"Zero Trust security\" refers to a cybersecurity model that eliminates implicit trust from networks and requires all users and devices to be continuously verified before being granted access to resources. The implementation of the Zero Trust security involves two distinct components: a Data Plane, responsible for defining and managing security policies, and a Control Plane, responsible for enforcing the security policies established by the Data Plane.",
      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correct_answers": ["True"],
      "explanation": "Zero Trust is a security model based on the principle of maintaining strict access controls and not trusting anyone by default, even those already inside the network perimeter. The Control Plane makes access decisions, and the Data Plane enforces them."

      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correct_answers": ["True"],
      "explanation": "A mantrap is a physical security control that uses a small space with two interlocking doors to control access. This prevents tailgating and ensures that only authorized individuals can enter a secure area."
