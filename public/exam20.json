      "correct_answers": ["ABAC"],
      "explanation": "ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) is an access control model that grants access based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment. This allows for very granular and flexible access control policies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Examples of properties used for defining access policies in Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model include:",
      "options": [
        "Subject (i.e., user or process requesting access)",
        "Type of action (for example \"read\", \"write\", \"execute\")",
        "Resource type (medical record, bank account etc.)",
        "Environment (contextual data, such as time of day or geolocation)",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correct_answers": ["All of the above"],
      "explanation": "ABAC policies are defined using attributes related to the subject (user), object (resource), action (what is being done), and environment (context)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which access control model defines access control rules with the use of statements that closely resemble natural language?",
      "options": ["DAC", "ABAC", "MAC", "RBAC"],
      "correct_answers": ["ABAC"],
