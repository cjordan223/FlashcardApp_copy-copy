    {
      "question": "An IV is a random or pseudorandom value used in cryptography to ensure that the same plaintext input does not produce the same ciphertext output, even when the same encryption key is used. The IV is typically used with encryption algorithms in block cipher modes to enhance security by introducing randomness to the encryption process.",
      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correct_answers": ["True"],
      "explanation": "An IV (Initialization Vector) is a fixed-size input to a cryptographic primitive that is typically required to be random or pseudorandom. Randomization is crucial for encryption schemes to achieve semantic security, a property whereby repeated usage of the scheme with the same key does not allow an attacker to infer relationships between segments of the encrypted message."
